# `pydot` changelog


1.4.2 (unreleased)
------------------

- Nothing changed yet.


1.4.1 (2018-12-12)
------------------

- Make graph, edge, node attributes order deterministic
- Fix string formatting after catching error (#201)


1.4.0 (2018-12-01)
------------------

- Installation of pydot in conda env on Windows directly supported
- Fixed comparing of SHA hash in regression tests (which fail now)


1.3.0 (2018-11-19)
------------------

- Dropped Python 2.6 support (#185)
- Move errno from os to builtin. Fixes #177 (#191, #182)


1.2.4 (2017-12-25)
------------------

- ENH: propagate `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` when calling GraphViz
- API: raise `OSError` when a GraphViz executable is not found
- API: add method `__str__` to classes `Node, Edge, Graph`
- API: add arg `encoding` to `Dot` methods `create, write`
- API: quote cluster names when necessary
- API: give source and destination nodes as separate args to `Edge.__init__`
- API: never ignore `src, dst`, overwrite if `points` defined in `obj_dict`


1.2.3 (2016-10-06)
------------------

- support Python 2.6
- several corrections
- quote empty strings to avoid graphviz errors


1.2.0 (2016-07-01)
------------------

- support Python 3
- bumped dependency to `pyparsing >= 2.1.4`
- tests running on Travis CI
- tests require `chardet`
- detect character encoding for most test files
  using the package `chardet`

API:

- on all operating systems, search GraphViz
  executables in environment `$PATH`,
  using `subprocess.Popen`.
  No paths hard-coded due to security and privacy issues.

- add option to pass GraphViz executable name
  or absolute path as `prog` to `pydot.Dot.write_*` methods.
  This provides an alternative to
  adding GraphViz to the `$PATH`.

- the functions:
    - `pydot.graph_from_dot_data`
    - `pydot.graph_from_dot_file`
    - `dot_parser.parse_dot_data`
  changed to always return a `list` of graphs,
  instead of behaving differently for singletons.

- require that the user explicitly give an encoding to
  the function `pydot.graph_from_dot_file`,
  with default encoding same as `io.open`.

- decode to unicode at program boundaries, and
  treat binary images as bytes,
  for more compatibility with python 3.
  Use `io.open`, instead of the built-in `open`.

- rm function `pydot.set_graphviz_executables`

- rm attribute `pydot.Dot.progs`


1.1.0 (2016-05-23)
------------------

- compatibility with `pyparsing >= 1.5.7`

API:

- `pydot.Graph.to_string`: hide `subgraph` keyword only if so requested
- produce `warnings.warn` if `pydot.dot_parser` fails to import,
  instead of `print`


1.0.29 (2016-05-16)
------------------

- Maintenance release that keeps the same API
- pin `pyparsing == 1.5.7`
- update version number in source code
- update `setup.py`


2004-04-28 21:50  carrer

	* pydot.py: Some of the changes already made should allow pydot to
	  run on OSX.  Bumped version to 0.9.2

2004-04-24 17:52  carrer

	* setup.py: Added more metainformation to the distribution.

2004-04-24 17:51  carrer

	* pydot.py: Added support for circo and fdp. Fixed piping mechanism
	  to not to capture stderr.

2004-04-24 13:26  carrer

	* ChangeLog, LICENSE, MANIFEST, README, setup.py: Adding
	  supplementary files to the distribution to the CVS.

2004-04-24 12:57  carrer

	* pydot.py: Bumped version to 0.9.1

2004-04-24 01:36  carrer

	* pydot.py: Implemented tweaks suggested by John B. Cole to handle
	  non-str nodes, converting them to strings.

2004-04-24 01:10  carrer

	* pydot.py: Applied patch for Windows support by Kent Johnson.

2004-04-24 01:05  carrer

	* pydot.py: Fixed to properly handle unicode strings in attributes.

2004-04-20 00:06  carrer

	* pydot.py:
	  Fixed silly error in graph_from_edges. When pasting the function
	  into the code, the references to the pydot module were not
	  removed, which are no longer needed since we now are _in_ the
	  module.

2004-04-19 23:33  carrer

	* pydot.py:
	  Added support to write files with the desired output format with
	  write_[format]
